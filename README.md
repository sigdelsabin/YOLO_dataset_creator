# YOLO_dataset_creator

Problem: Sometimes if we have multiple datasets of **large UAV 3 band images (mostly RGB)**  and same labels can be used for all of them. It is challenging to create ***small tiles, .txt labels and .yaml file*** for each large images.

Solution: If we have a **shapefile of labels and dataset directory**, we can use this repo to multiple datasets easily. We can also modify the ***train, test, valid ratio and crop size of images***. 

# This is the general structure how the code create the output
