# YOLO_dataset_creator

Problem: Sometimes if we have multiple datasets of large UAV 3 band images where we can use same labels it is time consuming to create labels for each of the dataset and difficult to manage. 

Solution: If we have a shapefile of labels and dataset directory, we can use this repo to multiple datasets easily. We can also modify the train, test, valid ratio and crop size of images. 

# This is the general structure how the code create the output
